          <strong>8. RETURNS</strong>
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          8.1 The majority of our products are personalised Services, and as
          such, there is typically no option to cancel the contract and return
          the Service (including physical products). However, you do have the
          right to reject a Service if it is faulty or significantly different
          from what was described (subject to 8.4). In such cases, we will
          request you to return the Service to us within 3 business days of
          receiving it. If you are eligible for a refund, we will reimburse the
          amount you paid to the original payment card. Alternatively, we may
          offer to reprint and resend the item if applicable. Please note that
          we do not provide both a refund and a resend option. No refund will be
          issued if the fault results from your actions, such as misuse of the
          Service, misspelled personalisation, or uploading low-resolution or
          small-sized images.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          8.2 For non-personalised and non-membership Services, you have the
          right to cancel your contract within 14 days of the day after the
          Service is delivered to you. You must then return the unused
          nonpersonalised Service to us within 14 days of notifying us of your
          cancellation and cover the return cost. We will refund the purchase
          price of the Service and its standard delivery charges (excluding any
          additional delivery charges, e.g., expedited delivery) within 14 days
          of receiving the returned Service. However, if the value of the
          Service has diminished due to excessive handling beyond what is
          necessary to check its condition, we may deduct an amount reflecting
          that reduction from the refund. Please note that the value of a
          Service may be reduced to zero if its seal or similar protective
          element is broken.

          representations regarding the Services, including, without limitation,
          quality, performance, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness
          for a particular purpose. We do not represent or warrant that the
          availability or use of the Services will be uninterrupted, timely,
          secure, error-free, or virus-free. We cannot accept responsibility or
          liability for a failure of your mobile network or internet provider,
          or any losses or damage suffered as a result, as this is beyond our
          control.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          11.2 We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Platform and
          the Services do not contain or disseminate any viruses or other
          malicious code. However, it is advisable to virus-check all materials
          used in connection with the Platform and the Services and regularly
          scan for the presence of viruses and other malicious code. We exclude,
          to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, all liability for

          processing of your personal data and against loss or destruction of,
          or damage to, your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of

          replace the Service (or the part in question) or refund to you the
          price paid for the Service (or an appropriate proportion of the
          price). We will have no further liability to you in respect of the
